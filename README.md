# Hi, I’m Diana 👋  
**Full-Stack Engineer (Frontend-focused)**

Full-Stack Engineer with a strong focus on **Frontend architecture, performance, and user experience**.  
I build **scalable web products** used by millions of users, mainly with **React and Next.js**, while confidently designing and integrating backend systems when needed.

I’ve built complex UIs from scratch, real-time and social features, admin panels, and multi-brand platforms in **eLearning** and **Gambling** domains - often owning features **end-to-end**, from design to production.
